            <section>The above image is the topology of my case study project in my Introduction to Networking Two. 
                In the project, my group was tasked to develop a pilot network capable of being integrated 
                such that all branches will be connected through a dedicated WAN connection using
                BGP and can be managed completely remotely from the Ontario Tech Residence.</section>
            <section>This project served as a great challenge that tested the skills we had learned in the lectures and practiced during our labs.</section>

            <section>The above image is the topology of my case study project in my first Introduction to Networking course. 
                The following diagram shows the topology of a corporate network consisting of three buildings that my partner and I had to set up. 
                Each building contains a number of PCs and a switched LAN. 
                Two buildings are connected to a core router, which is connected to a Gateway router. 
                A remote site (Building 3) is connected to a remote site router that is connected separately to the Gateway router.
                The Gateway router has a single connection to an Internet server with IP address 108.0.0.1. 
                The link between the Gateway router and the Internet server uses the subnet 108.0.0.0/30.
            </section>
            <section>This project served as a great first-time experience with a network that was bigger than what we dealt with in our labs.</section>
